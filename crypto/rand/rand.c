/* It's assumed that the operating system always has an unfailing source of
 * entropy which is accessed via |CRYPTO_sysrand|. (If the operating system
 * entropy source fails, it's up to |CRYPTO_sysrand| to abort the processâ€”we
 * don't try to handle it.)
 *
 * We assume that the OS entropy is safe from fork()ing and VM duplication.
 * This might be a bit of a leap of faith, esp on Windows, but there's nothing
 * that we can do about it.
 *
 * In addition, the hardware may provide a low-latency RNG. Intel's rdrand
 * instruction is the canonical example of this. When a hardware RNG is
 * available we don't need to worry about an RNG failure arising from fork()ing
 * the process or moving a VM, so we can keep thread-local RNG state and XOR
 * the hardware entropy in. (Support for this was in BoringSSL, but it was
 * removed.) */
